# Binary-Search-Visualizer-Project

I have built a binary search visualizer project to help users understand the binary search algorithm in a simple and interactive way. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates a sorted array of numbers and shows the step-by-step process of how binary search works.
During the search, the midpoint of the array is calculated and highlighted, along with the current range of the search space. As the algorithm narrows down the search, the range is continuously updated, giving a clear view of how the search space reduces. If the target element is found, it is highlighted in gold, making it easy to spot.
This visual representation makes it much easier for users to understand the binary search process. Instead of just reading about it or solving problems on paper, users can now see how the search operates, how the midpoints are chosen, and how the algorithm narrows down the possibilities. Itâ€™s a helpful tool for students or anyone learning algorithms, as they can visualize the flow and logic of binary search in real time.
